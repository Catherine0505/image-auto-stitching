    dist2  Calculates squared distance between two sets of points.

    Description
    D = DIST2(X, C) takes two matrices of vectors and calculates the
    squared Euclidean distance between them.  Both matrices must be of
    the same column dimension.  If X has M rows and N columns, and C has
    L rows and N columns, then the result has M rows and L columns.  The

    Jth row of C.
